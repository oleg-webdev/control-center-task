# AutoFleet test assignment

- react custom build
- Managing app state through [unstated lib](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated)

Unstated providers located: ```<rootDir>src/providers/*```

Pages implemented: 

```<rootDir>src/pages/dashboard``` (last slide)

```<rootDir>src/pages/management```


Driver and path on map is just json data.

## Getting Started
```npm install``` or just ```yarn```

```npm run dev``` or ```yarn dev```

### BONUS: Testing Sidebar feature
```npm run test``` or ```yarn test```

Testing file located: ```<rootDir>src/providers/sidebar.test.js```


### Disclaimer

Not sure what functionality was expected, so, I did it as I think it could work

without expireence with 'unstated' lib and google maps

Styles is totally off because of there is no assets or style guides provided

I can do fancy styles, I promise =)
