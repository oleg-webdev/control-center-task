# AutoFleet test assignment

- react custom build
- Managing state through [unstated lib](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated)

Task without any provided assets, so there is placeholders instead.

Also driver data is just json data.

## Getting Started
```npm install``` or just ```yarn```

```npm run dev``` or ```yarn dev```

### BONUS: Testing Sidebar feature
```npm run test``` or ```yarn test```

Testing file located: ```<rootDir>src/providers/sidebar.test.js```


#### Disclaimer
Styles is totally off because of there is no assets or style guides provided

Not sure what functionality was expected, so, I did it as I think it could work

without expireence with 'unstated' lib and google maps
